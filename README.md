Inspired by: 
["Build Your Own HTTP server" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/http-server/overview).

[HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) is the
protocol that powers the web. In this challenge, you'll build a HTTP/1.1 server
that is capable of serving multiple clients.

[HTTP request syntax](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html),
and more.

It is a small program to learn how TCP Servers work, specifically HTTP servers. The objective is to learn how TCP servers are created, how large number of requests are handled concurrently.

1. Ensure you have `python (3.11)` installed locally
1. Run `./your_server.sh` to run your program, which is implemented in
   `app/main.py`.
